# Kickstarting with Excel

## Project Overview 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to explore the outcomes of different kickstarters campaigns for plays. We compared successful, failed, and canceled play campaigns to  their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![Theater Outcomes Based by Launch Date](https://github.com/NikWalker/kickstarter_analysis2/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png?raw=true)

Based on the launch date outcomes for plays, campaigns started during the month of May has the highest rate of success. We see a sharp spike in successful outcomes from April to May. Note that we see a steady decrease of successfull outcomes as the summer months continue with winter having the least amount of successful outcomes. When looking at the failed play campaigns, the amount failed from month to month remain generally consistant throughout the year. This may indicate failure due to other variables within the Kickstarter.

### Analysis of Outcomes Bassed on Goals
![Outcome based of goal](

The most successful Play campaigns were those with a goal under $1000, with a success rate of 76%. After we start seeing goals over five thousand we see a near twenty percent drop once the goals reach ten thousand. This downward trend of successful campaigns continues to drop to a low success rate of twenty percent as the goal totals reach near $35,000. There is however an increased success rate of 67% of campaigns between $35,000 and $50,000. After a plays goal exceeds that $50,000 mark, there does not seem to be a chance for a successful campaign
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
