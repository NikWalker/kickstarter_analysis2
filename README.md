# Kickstarting with Excel

## Project Overview 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to explore the outcomes of different kickstarters campaigns for plays. We compared successful, failed, and canceled play campaigns to  their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the launch date outcomes for plays, campaigns started during the month of May has the highest rate of success. We see a sharp spike in successful outcomes from April to May. Note that we see a steady decrease of successfull outcomes as the summer months continue with winter having the least amount of successful outcomes. When looking at the failed play campaigns, the amount failed from month to month remain generally consistant throughout the year. This may indicate failure due to other variables within the Kickstarter.

### Analysis of Outcomes Bassed on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
